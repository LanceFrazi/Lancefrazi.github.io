       <ul>
         <li>Research Assistant at University of St.Thomas, Math Department: Developed an algorithm to generate sets of randomized knot structures. Learned how
        to analyze large data-sets in the R and C programming languages. Team presented
         findings at the Joint Mathematics Meeting in San Antonio, Texas
         </li>
         <p class ="head">Significant Course Work</p>
       </ul>
         <ul>
           <li> Experimental Physics: Built circuitry needed to move a stepper motor to operate a chaotic pendulum. Developed
            a program in LabVIEW to analyze data-sets that were produced from running the
            chaotic pendulum and to visualize chaotic motion over a period of time.</li>
