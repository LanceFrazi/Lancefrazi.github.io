Education

May 2017 Bachelor of Arts in Science, University of St. Thomas, Minnesota
Major: Physics

Work Experience

 Research Assistant at University of St. Thomas Minnesota
2014-2015 Math Department
Developed an algorithm to generate sets of randomized knot structures. Learned how
to analyze large data-sets in the R and C programming languages. Team presented
findings at the Joint Mathematics Meeting in San Antonio, Texas

Course Work

 Experimental Physics at University of St. Thomas Minnesota
2017 Physics Department
Built circuitry needed to move a stepper motor to operate a chaotic pendulum. Developed
a program in LabVIEW to analyze data-sets that were produced from running the
chaotic pendulum and to visualize chaotic motion over a period of time.
